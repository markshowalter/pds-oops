NOTES and REQUESTS

3/25 from Rob

You might consider using os.path.join throughout your code to combine directories and filenames.  That avoids problems with, for example, not having a trailing "/" on directories.  Currently you require the HST_IDC_PATH environment variable to end with "/", but not the SPICE_PATH one.  That might be confusing for users.

Startup times might improve is we avoid calling spicedb.furnish_solar_system() in define_solar_system(). Ideally, SP kernels should only be furnished as they are needed.
